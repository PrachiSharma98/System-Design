1. Parking Lot:
   - A parking lot consists of multiple parking spaces.
   - Each parking space has a unique identifier or number.
   - The parking lot may have different types of spaces such as regular, compact, handicap, etc.
   - The parking lot can have multiple levels or sections.

2. Vehicle:
   - Each vehicle entering the parking lot is identified by a unique vehicle ID.
   - Vehicle information such as license plate number, make, and model can be stored.

3. Ticket:
   - When a vehicle enters the parking lot, a ticket is issued containing the following information:
     - Ticket number or ID
     - Entry timestamp
     - Vehicle ID
     - Parking space number

4. Parking Lot Management System:
   - The parking lot management system is responsible for managing the parking lot and handling various operations.

5. Operations:
   - Entry:
     - When a vehicle arrives at the entrance, a ticket is issued.
     - The ticket is assigned the current timestamp and a vacant parking space.
     - The vehicle is assigned the corresponding parking space.
     - The vehicle enters the parking lot.

   - Exit:
     - When a vehicle wants to leave the parking lot, the ticket is processed.
     - The parking fee is calculated based on the duration of stay.
     - The ticket is marked as paid, and the vehicle is allowed to exit the parking lot.

   - Availability Check:
     - The parking lot management system keeps track of available parking spaces.
     - It can provide information about the number of vacant spaces in each section or level.

   - Security:
     - The parking lot can have security cameras to monitor the entry and exit points.
     - License plate recognition systems can be used to track vehicles and ensure security.

6. Database:
   - The system can utilize a database to store and retrieve information about vehicles, tickets, and parking spaces.
   - The database can be used to maintain records of transactions, generate reports, etc.

This low-level design provides a basic structure and functionality for a parking lot system. The actual implementation may vary depending on specific requirements and technologies used.
